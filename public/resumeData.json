I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Tejas for almost a year, during which we worked together to develop an enterprise level application to be used by Washington State University to send out notices to students. Above all, I was impressed with Tejas’s ability to go above and beyond what was required to ensure we were on top of things. And, of course, his openness to discuss new ideas even later in the project was impressive too. Tejas would be a true asset for any positions requiring front-end development and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.",

He is productive, intelligent, has excellent communication skills, and is willing to help whenever needed. Tejas is the kind of person who does anything for the group’s interest. A great colleague!",

Throughout the project Tejas showed good team work, leadership and management skills. His knowledge in the respective domain was of great use towards building the project and making it a success. Not only that, but he is also someone who would make a very tense environment light by his good sense of humor which we could use well during stressful times. I always looked forward to working with him and was always glad to learn new things from him. I'd like to recommend him to potential employers as he is very knowledgeable, patient and knows how to get work done. Also he will bring about much needed vibrance in your team.",
