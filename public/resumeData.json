I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Tejas for almost a year, during which we worked together to develop an enterprise level application to be used by Washington State University to send out notices to students. Above all, I was impressed with Tejas’s ability to go above and beyond what was required to ensure we were on top of things. And, of course, his openness to discuss new ideas even later in the project was impressive too. Tejas would be a true asset for any positions requiring front-end development and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.",

Not only that, but he is also someone who would make a very tense environment light by his good sense of humor which we could use well during stressful times. I always looked forward to working with him and was always glad to learn new things from him. I'd like to recommend him to potential employers as he is very knowledgeable, patient and knows how to get work done. Also he will bring about much needed vibrance in your team.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the work we did together last year, as it's not often that I get to give that type of solo repertoire to just anyone. When I've got a student as skilled and hardworking as you, it never feels like a job, but a meaningful artistic collaboration; to me, that's the highest praise. I hope that you'll return to private study at some point, as your voice is a gift from God. Truthfully, I don't think you understand yet what it is you possess, so..please please please don't let it go to waste. Keep the music we worked on warm and bring it to your next teacher when your life allows for more freedom.",
